# Front End Technical Challenge

_Context: This was originally created for a take home technical test that never got reviewed. I actually haven't touched Angular much since this, having moved mostly to React, but I still think I did a decent job.  It's been nearly 2 years since I created, and the original invite for the review is still pending so I think the chances of it going much further are pretty slim! So rather than sitting privately on my Github, I thought I might as well make it public.

Hi! 

I chose Angular purely as it's the framework I'm most comfortable with, but all the techniques used are transferable to any framework or stack.

No component or CSS library was used in this project. Everything was built _from scratch_ (CSS is compiled from SCSS). Due to this there may be some visual bugs, especially on IE. I could have used a framework/library like Bootstrap or Bulma but, I thought I would use this to showcase my proficiency with building pages rather than pixel perfect on all platforms.

This project was built using a few different techniques -

* Reuseable components
* Modular Design
* TypeScript
* SCSS Partials and Mix-ins
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Navigations are dynamically populated
* Background images and stripe pattern were recreated in Illustrator
* Source control using Git
* CI/CD using Netlify
* & much more.

If you've any questions, please just give me a shout! You can check out more of my work on my [website](https://dermothughes.com).

Thanks for checking me out!
