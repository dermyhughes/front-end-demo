# Made to Engage Technical Challenge

Hi! 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.

No component or CSS library was used in this project. Everything was built _from scratch_ (CSS is compiled from SCSS). Due to this there may be some visual bugs, especially on IE. I could have used a framework/library like Bootstrap or Bulma but, I thought I would use this to showcase my proficiency with building pages rather than pixel perfect on all platforms.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
